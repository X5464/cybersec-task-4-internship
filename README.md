Adjust commands to your interface (replace lo0 with en0 or omit on INTERFACE for all interfaces).




BELOW ARE THE PROPER STEPS AND CONCLUSIONS:


macOS Firewall Configuration 

Step 1 – Enable the Built‑in Firewall: In macOS Ventura or later, open System Settings, select Network, then click Firewall ￼. (On macOS Monterey or earlier, go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Firewall ￼ ￼.) Click the lock and authenticate, then click “Turn On Firewall” ￼. This enables the Application Firewall (socketfilterfw) and prevents unsolicited incoming connections.

After enabling, the Network settings will show Firewall – Inactive/On. The above screenshot (placeholder name) illustrates System Settings → Network → Firewall (showing it inactive).

Step 2 – Block a Specific Port (Telnet): To block inbound Telnet (TCP port 23), use the low‑level Packet Filter (pfctl). Open Terminal and add a pf rule. For example, to drop all TCP traffic to port 23 on the loopback interface, run:

echo "block drop quick on lo0 proto tcp from any to any port = 23" | sudo pfctl -e -f -

This uses pfctl -e to enable pf and -f - to load the rule from stdin. (If you want to block on all network interfaces instead of just loopback, replace lo0 with the appropriate interface or omit it for “any.”) In effect, all new connections to port 23 will be dropped ￼.

Step 3 – Allow Essential Traffic (SSH, etc.): Ensure critical services remain reachable. For example, allow SSH (port 22) by adding a pass rule before blocking other traffic:

echo "pass in proto tcp from any to any port 22 keep state" | sudo pfctl -f -

This tells pf to permit incoming SSH connections. Similarly, you could allow other services or trusted apps. In sample configurations, rules like pass in proto tcp from any to any port 22 are used to keep SSH open ￼. (If using the Application Firewall GUI instead of pf, ensure Remote Login (SSH) is enabled under System Settings → General → Sharing, and explicitly allow the “sshd” service if prompted.)

When enabled, the firewall settings show a toggle and an Options button. The above screenshot (placeholder name) shows Firewall – On. You can click Options… to configure app rules.

Step 4 – Test the Rule Safely: Test locally using loopback addresses so no real IPs are exposed. For example, start a simple listener on port 23 (sudo nc -l 23 in one Terminal) and in another Terminal try connecting: telnet 127.0.0.1 23 or nc -vz 127.0.0.1 23. With the pf rule active, the connection should be blocked (connection refused or timeout). To confirm, disable pf (sudo pfctl -d) and retry: now the connection should succeed (or no block). Using nc (netcat) to scan ports is built‑in on macOS ￼, e.g. nc -vz localhost 23. This way you verify the block without any real network traffic or sensitive data.

You can also test blocking by enabling “Block all incoming connections” or adding a dummy app rule. The Firewall Options pane (above) shows how you can block all or allow/deny specific apps. For our test, we used pfctl, but GUI tests would appear here.

Step 5 – Revert Changes: Once testing is done, undo the rule. If you used pfctl with -e -f, disable pf entirely with:

sudo pfctl -d

to stop packet filtering ￼. If you added rules to /etc/pf.conf, remove them and reload the original config:

sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf

to restore default settings ￼. Also lock the firewall pane again and (optionally) turn the GUI firewall back off via System Settings (so the system returns to its initial state). This cleanup ensures no residual blocks remain.

Step 6 – Capture Safe Screenshots: When taking screenshots of the firewall settings for your report, be careful to remove any personal info (your Apple ID, local IPs, etc.). Use macOS’s screenshot tool (Shift+Cmd+4) and then open the image in Preview. In Preview, use Tools → Annotate → Rectangle to draw a black box over any sensitive data ￼. (You can also enable stealth mode toggle or other neutral UI elements to avoid exposing details.) Alternatively, tools like CleanShot X or Xnapper can pixelate or blur content. In short, crop or block out any real network info so only generic labels (like “Firewall: On”) appear. For example, if showing the Network pane, cover your Wi-Fi network name or IP with a shape. Preview’s annotation (shown in the referenced guide ￼) is a simple way to do this.

This  Task 4: Configuring the macOS Firewall. All steps below were performed safely without exposing real IPs or private data.

What Was Done
	•	Enabled the macOS firewall: Turned on the built-in Application Firewall via System Settings ￼ ￼.
	•	Blocked Telnet port: Used pfctl to block incoming TCP on port 23 (Telnet) ￼.
	•	Allowed SSH: Added a rule to permit port 22 (SSH) traffic ￼.
	•	Tested the block: Verified the rule by attempting a local connection (nc/telnet to 127.0.0.1) ￼.
	•	Reverted changes: Disabled pf and/or removed the test rule to restore original firewall state ￼ ￼.
	•	Documented with screenshots: Captured and annotated firewall UI screenshots, hiding all personal info.

Tools Used
	•	System Settings → Network → Firewall: The macOS GUI for the Application Firewall ￼.
	•	pfctl (Packet Filter): Built-in command-line firewall. We used it to block and allow specific ports ￼ ￼.
	•	socketfilterfw (Optional): The command-line interface to the Application Firewall (e.g. sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate on ￼).
	•	Terminal (CLI): For running pfctl, nc, and firewall commands.
	•	Netcat (nc): To test connectivity (e.g. nc -vz localhost 23 ￼).
	•	Screenshot tools: macOS built-in screenshot and Preview for annotating sensitive info ￼.

Commands / Steps

How the Firewall Works

macOS actually has two layers of firewall ￼. The Application Firewall (socketfilterfw) is the one in System Settings, letting you allow or block apps. It primarily manages application-level rules. The Packet Filter (pfctl) is a lower-level firewall (also used in BSD) that works at the network level, letting you block specific ports or addresses ￼. In this task we used both: the GUI firewall was turned on for general protection, and pfctl was used to precisely block port 23. By default the macOS Application Firewall only filters incoming app connections; it won’t block arbitrary ports unless you use pf. Conversely, pf can be scripted to drop unwanted traffic (statefully or statelessly) based on your rules. In essence, enabling the firewall adds rules to reject or accept packets; stateful rules (keep state) allow return traffic automatically while blocking new inbound attempts on blocked ports.

Placeholder Screenshots

For security, screenshots in this repo should use dummy or anonymized images. Suggested filenames for illustrative screenshots (without actual sensitive content) include:
	•	network-settings-firewall.png – System Settings → Network showing the Firewall entry.
	•	firewall-enabled-toggle.png – Firewall pane with the toggle ON (no real hostname shown).
	•	firewall-options-menu.png – Firewall Options dialog (blocking mode and app list) with dummy apps.



Learning Outcomes
	•	Gained hands-on experience with the macOS Application Firewall and the lower-level pf system.
	•	Learned how to add and remove port-based rules safely using pfctl.
	•	Practiced testing firewall behavior locally (using nc/telnet on 127.0.0.1) without exposing external networks.
	•	Understood the importance of allowing essential services (like SSH) while blocking others.
	•	Learned to document security settings carefully, including how to safely redact personal data in screenshots ￼.

In summary, this task demonstrated basic firewall configuration skills on macOS: enabling protection, selectively blocking a port, verifying the block, and cleaning up—all while preserving privacy. The firewall effectively filters incoming connections (statefully) to secure the system ￼ ￼.
